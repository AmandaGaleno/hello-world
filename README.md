###About Me
I am a Process Engineer, chemist, six sigma Balckbelt, and Regulatory Affairs/FDA expert: entering iteration 4 of my career with an MS in Data Science (expected completion 2027)

Iteration 1:  Undergrad in Physics and Mathematics followed by 5 years leading GE Healthcare's Biomedical products (FTA Elute, FASTslide protein microarray, and TrackEtch membranes).  I created and implemented the first protein microarray surface manufacturing technology for a laser-driven automation system.  This system used simple x-y coordinate recognition to etch NTcellulose polymer excess away from glass surfaces, rather than masking.  The technique is still used today in spin coating for semi conductors, Biomedical research (Cancer and immunoactives), and surface coating.  Process created with Damon Pawlak of Schleicher & Schuell in 2007.

Iteration 2:  MBA and ASQ followed by 5 years setting up Amazon's distribution centers in Arizona and California.  Projects with cost savings in the billions, multi-D automation, 17-21 miles of conveyance per building, and close to exponential growth.  Repeatable and precise processes and models used in 151 distribution centers for Amazon Fulfillment.  

Iteration 3:  ISO 13485 Biomedical auditor responding to both forward and reverse multi-audits for in-vitro diagnostic tests and surgically implantable medical devices.  Responsible for test designs capable of 1st-pass FDA and MDA registrations, including Bausch & Lomb's line of surgical lenses in 2023.

Iteration 4:  Basic Python Certificate (eCornell, 2025) + Data Science Certificate (eCornell, 2025).  Now enrolled in OMSDS at BOSTON UNIVERSITY ... Hello World!!!!!!!!
